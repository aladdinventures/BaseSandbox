Ù†# Maintenance Guide for Aladdin-sandbox Monorepo CI/CD System

## Introduction
This document is a maintenance guide for the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system implemented in the `aladdin-sandbox` monorepo. The purpose of this guide is to provide instructions for ensuring the correct functioning, stability, and security of the CI/CD system over time.

## 1. Periodic Checks and Monitoring

To ensure the health of the CI/CD system, periodic checks and active monitoring are essential:

*   **Monitor Workflow Executions**: Regularly check the GitHub Actions dashboard to stay informed about the status of Workflow executions. Look for failed Workflows, Workflows that take an unusually long time to run, or Workflows that have been unexpectedly triggered.
*   **Review `mamos_runner.py` Reports**: Examine the reports generated in `aladdin-sandbox/reports/`. The `summary.md` file provides an overview, and `details/*.md` files offer more specifics if issues arise.
*   **Check Resource Consumption**: In GitHub Actions, you can view resource consumption (e.g., execution time) for Workflows. A sudden increase in resource usage might indicate problems such as infinite loops, inefficient tests, or unintended changes.
*   **Verify External Service Status**: Regularly check the status of external services like GitHub (for GitHub Actions) and Render.com (for deployment) to ensure their availability.

## 2. Configuration Management

The CI/CD system's configuration must be managed carefully:

*   **`config/projects.yaml`**: This file contains the configuration for all projects. Any changes to build, test commands, or deployment settings must be done with care and tested before merging into the `main` branch.
    *   **Adding a New Project**: To add a new project, create a new entry in `projects.yaml` and define its build, test, and deploy commands.
    *   **Updating an Existing Project**: If there are changes in a project's build or test process, update the corresponding entry in `projects.yaml`.
*   **GitHub Actions Workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)**: These files define the CI/CD execution logic. Any changes to these files (e.g., modifying triggers, permissions, or steps) must be carefully reviewed and tested.
*   **Secrets Management**: `RENDER_API_KEY` and other secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets. Ensure these secrets are up-to-date and accessible only by authorized personnel. Adhere to secret rotation policies.

## 3. Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution

*   **Failed Workflow**: 
    1.  Go to the GitHub Actions dashboard and click on the failed Workflow run.
    2.  Locate the failed Job and review its logs. Error messages are usually found at the end of the logs.
    3.  If the issue is related to `mamos_runner.py`, check the detailed project report (`aladdin-sandbox/reports/details/<project_name>_report.md`).
    4.  Based on the error message, inspect and correct the relevant code (in the project, `mamos_runner.py`, or Workflow files).
*   **Deployment Issues**: 
    1.  If deployment fails, check the logs of the deployment Job in GitHub Actions.
    2.  If a `401 Client Error: Unauthorized` is observed, verify the `RENDER_API_KEY` in GitHub Secrets.
    3.  If another error is received from Render.com, check the Render.com dashboard for more details.
*   **Performance Issues**: 
    1.  If Workflows are unexpectedly slow, check resource consumption (CPU/RAM) in GitHub Actions.
    2.  Inefficient tests or infinite loops in project code can increase execution time. Add profiling tools to the test stage if necessary.

## 4. Updates and Upgrades

*   **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update project dependencies (in `requirements.txt` for Python, `package.json` for Node.js). This helps improve security and performance.
*   **GitHub Actions Updates**: GitHub continuously adds new features to GitHub Actions. Update your Workflows to use the latest versions and best practices.
*   **`mamos_runner.py` Updates**: If new functionalities are needed or `mamos_runner.py`'s performance needs improvement, update it. These changes must be thoroughly tested.

## 5. Security

*   **Secrets Review**: Regularly review and, if necessary, rotate secrets stored in GitHub.
*   **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the GitHub repository and GitHub Secrets.
*   **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools (e.g., code or dependency vulnerability scanners) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically identify vulnerabilities.

## 6. Documentation

*   Any significant changes to the CI/CD system, configurations, or maintenance processes must be recorded in relevant documentation (like this guide). This helps preserve knowledge and facilitates the training process for new team members.

## 7. Support

In case of complex issues or a need for specialized assistance, consult the support team or CI/CD experts.
